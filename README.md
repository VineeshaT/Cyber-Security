**Cybersecurity**: Protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.

**Defensive Security _(Blue Team)_:** "Defend and detect." Focuses on securing systems, monitoring threats, and responding to incidents.

**Offensive Security _(Red Team)_:** "Attack to improve." Ethically simulates cyberattacks to find and fix vulnerabilities.

**_Purple Team_:** "Collaborate to strengthen." Combines red and blue teams to improve defense through real-time feedback.

**SOC (Security Operations Center):** A team and facility dedicated to monitoring, detecting, and responding to cybersecurity threats 24/7.

**Incident Response:** The process of identifying, containing, and recovering from a security breach.

**Threat Intelligence:** Knowledge about existing or emerging threats used to proactively defend systems.

**Vulnerability Management:** Identifying, prioritizing, and fixing security weaknesses before attackers exploit them.
